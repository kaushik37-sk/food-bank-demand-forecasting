# AI-Based Food Bank Demand Forecasting System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a data-driven system that helps food banks forecast demand and improve inventory and distribution planning. The goal is to support operational decision-making by identifying demand trends and potential shortage periods using historical data.

## Problem Statement
Food banks often rely on historical averages or manual planning when preparing for demand fluctuations. This can lead to shortages during peak periods or excess waste during low-demand periods. There is a need for a simple, interpretable forecasting tool that supports staff planning without increasing workload.

## Proposed Solution
I am developing a machine learning–based forecasting system that:
- Analyzes historical food distribution and donation data
- Predicts short-term demand trends
- Flags high-risk periods for shortages
- Presents insights through a simple, easy-to-use dashboard

## Planned Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline
- Baseline demand forecasting model
- Improved machine learning model with performance evaluation
- Web-based dashboard for visualization and insights
- Comparison against historical planning methods

## Current Status
Project planning and outreach phase. Development will begin after defining requirements with a partner food bank.

## Ethics & Data Privacy
All data will be handled responsibly and only include information explicitly shared with permission. No personally identifiable or sensitive client data will be used.
